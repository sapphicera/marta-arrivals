## MARTA Rail Realtime RESTful API

**PROJECT GOAL**: Filter data from the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) RESTful API using Golang

*THIS PROGRAM WILL...* âœ¨ 

- Fetch API data in ~10-Second Intervals
- Filter response data to "TRAIN_ID", "STATION", and "WAITING_SECONDS" key-value pairs
- Filter response data to items whose "WAITING_SECONDS" are less than 120

## Additional Information ðŸ’¬ 

This is my first time using **Golang**! This program took around *one day* to create after hearing about Golang for the very first time. It's been hard for me to parse the best way to error-handle, so any feedback would be greatly appreciated!
